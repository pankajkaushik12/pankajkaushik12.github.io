<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a software developer specializing in real-time graphics, AI-driven game development, and physics simulations. With expertise in C++, CUDA, OptiX, Unreal Engine, AR/VR systems, I build rendering and AI systems. My recent work includes implementing physically based rendering, foveated rendering, and reinforcement learning agents in Unreal Engine 5. I thrive on optimizing performance, exploring modern computer architecture, and integrating advanced physics engines like PhysX.
